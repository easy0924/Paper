\begin{abstract}
We propose a novel data-driven rule-based preordering approach, which uses the information of syntax tree and word alignment to reorder the words in source sentences before decoding in a phrase-based SMT system between English and Chinese. The preorering algorithm extracts reordering patterns from multiple levels of the syntax trees of the training data and applies the rules on the source sentences in a similar manner. We've conducted experiments in English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation directions. Our results show that the approach has led to improved translation quality both when it was applied separately on the baseline or when it was combined with some other reordering approaches. We report an improvement of $0.43$ in BLEU score when our preordering approach was used in addition to the short rule \cite{short}, long rule\cite{long} and tree rule \cite{tree} based preordering approaches in the English-to-Chinese translation direction. There's also an improvement of $0.3$ in BLEU score when our preordering approach was used in addition to the aforementioned preordering approaches in the Chinese-to-English translation direction. Through the translation examples, we've also found improvements in syntactic structure with our preordering approach.

\section{Introduction}

Word order is a general issue when we want to translate text from one language to the other. Different languages normally have different word orders and the difference could be very huge. Among all the languages, Chinese is one language which is very different from English, because they belong to different language families and have long period of separately development. Both languages have a Subject-Verb-Object order, but they also have a lot of differences in word order. Especially sentences in both languages can sometimes have completely different syntactic structures. The differences may involve long-distance or unstructured position changes.

Most state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT systems use language model, phrase table or decoder to adjust the word order. Or an additional reordering model is used in the log-linear model for word reordering. However, these methods may have some disadvantages, such as some don't handle long-distance reordering, some don't handle unstructured reordering and some are rather time consuming.

Encouraged by the results from the paper \cite{short}, \cite{long} and \cite{tree}, we further propose a new data-driven, rule-based preordering method, which extracts and applies reordering rules based on syntax tree. The method is called Multi-Level-Tree (MLT) reordering, which orders the constituents on multiple levels of the syntax tree all together. This preordering method rearranges the words in source language into a similar order as they are supposed to be in the target language before translation. With the appropriate word order, better translation quality can be achieved. Especially, our preordering method is very suitable for translation between language pairs like English and Chinese, which have very different word orders. Besides, the method can also be combined with the above mentioned rule-based reordering methods to achieve better translation quality. 

\section{Related Work}

Word reordering is an important problem for statistical machine translation, which has long been addressed.

In a phrase-based SMT system, there are several possibilities to change the word orders. Words can be reordered during the decoding phase by setting a window, which allows the decoder to choose the next word for translation. Reordering could also be influenced by the language model, because the language model give probability of how a certain word is likely to follow. Different language model may give different probability, which further influences the decision made by log-linear model. Other ways to change the word orders include using distance based reordering models or lexicalized reordering models \cite{tillmann2004, koehn2005}. The lexicalized reordering model reorders the phrases by using information of how the neighboring phrases change orientations.

The hierarchical phrase-based translation model \cite{hier} is especially suitable for Chinese translation, and provide very good translation results. It extracts hierarchical rules by using information of the syntactic structure. Phrases from different hierarchies, or so-called phrases of phrases, are reordered during the decoding. 

The idea of phrases on different hierarchies has inspired us to create this preordering method based on multiple levels of the syntax tree. Besides, we also hope to detach the reordering from decoding phase and do it separately in a pre-process before decoding, in order to reduce the time for translation. This kind of preordering approaches use linguistic information to modify the word orders. 

Reordering approaches can also be rule-based, which extracts different types of reordering rules by observing reordering patterns from the training data and apply the rules to the sentences to be translated. Depends on how the rules are defined, different information may be used such as word alignments, POS tags, syntax trees, etc.

Some early approaches use manually defined reordering rules based on the linguistic information for particular languages \cite{collins2005clause, popovic2006pos,habash2007syntactic}. Especially \cite{syntactic} is based on Chinese and has analyzed the reordering cases between English and Chinese based on syntactic structure. Later come the data-driven methods \cite{zhang2007chunk, crego2008using}, which learn the reordering rules automatically. 

\cite{short} introduced the idea of extracting reordering rules from the POS tag sequences of training data and use them for reordering. \cite{long} went further, and developed a method for long-distance word reordering, which works good on German-English translation task due to the long-distance shift of verbs. The method extracts discontinuous reordering rules in addition to the continuous ones, which contains a placeholder to match several words and enables the word to shift cross long distance.

Afterwards, \cite{tree} introduced a novel approach to reorder the words based on syntax tree, which leads to further improvements on translation quality. The algorithm takes syntactic structure of the sentences into account and extract the rules from the syntax tree by detecting the reordering of child sequences. It also has the variant based only on part of the child sequences which is suitable for language with flat syntactic structure such as German.

Recently, \cite{google} introduced a novel classified preordering approach. Unlike existing preordering models, it trains feature-rich discriminative classifiers that directly predict the target side word order. It reorders the children in subtrees in a similar manner as the syntax tree based method, but trains different classifiers for nodes with different number of children.

However, these approaches which are bases on POS tag sequences or syntax trees are mostly designed for German and are not especially adapted for Chinese translation. As Chinese has very different word orders, a reordering approach, which can further explore the syntactic structure of Chinese and utilize this information for reordering, is desirable.

Oracle reordering has also shown values for evaluating the potential of preordering. \cite{metrics} introduced the permutation distance metrics which can be used to measure reordering quality. And \cite{birch2} described how we can construct permutations from the word alignment as oracle reordering.

\section{Results}

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{First page}

The first page should have the paper title, author(s), and affiliation(s)
centered on the page across both columns. The remainder of the text 
must be in the two-column format, staying within the indicated image 
area. 

\subsubsection{Paper Title}
The paper title must be in boldface. All non-function words must be capitalized,
and all other words in the title must be lower case. The paper title is centered
across the top of the two columns on the first page as indicated above.

\subsubsection{Authors' Name(s)}
The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear centered below the paper
title. If space permits, include a mailing address here. The templates indicate
the area where the title and author information should go. These items need not
be confined to the number of lines indicated; papers with multiple
authors and affiliations may require two or more lines. 
Note that the submission version of technical papers \emph{should be 
anonymized for review}. 

\subsubsection{Abstract}
Each paper must contain an abstract that appears at the beginning of the paper.

\subsection{Basic layout features}

\begin{itemize}
%\itemsep -1.3mm
\item Proceedings will be printed in A4 format. The layout is designed 
so that files, when printed in US Letter format, include all material 
but margins are not symmetric. 
Although this is not an absolute requirement, if at all possible,
{\bf PLEASE TRY TO MAKE YOUR SUBMISSION IN A4 FORMAT.}
\item Two columns are used except for the title part and possibly for large 
figures that need a full page width.
\item Left margin is 20 mm.
\item Column width is 80 mm.
\item Spacing between columns is 10 mm.
\item Top margin 25 mm (except first page 30 mm to title top).
\item Text height (without headers and footers) is maximum 235 mm.
\item Headers and footers must be left empty (they will be added for 
printing).
\item Check indentations and spacings by comparing to this 
example file (in pdf format).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Headings}

Section headings are centered in boldface
with the first word capitalized and the rest of the heading in 
lower case. Sub-headings appear like major headings, except they 
start at the left margin in the column.
Sub-sub-headings appear like sub-headings, except they are in italics 
and not boldface. See the examples given in this 
file. No more than 3 levels of headings should be used.

\subsection{Text font}

Times or Times Roman font is used for the main text. Recommended 
font size is 9 points which is also the minimum allowed size.
Other font types may be used if needed for 
special purposes. While making the final PostScript file, 
remember to include all fonts!

\LaTeX\ users: DO NOT USE Computer Modern FONT FOR TEXT (Times is 
specified in the style file). If possible, make the final 
document using POSTSCRIPT FONTS.
This is necessary given that, for example, equations with 
non-ps Computer Modern are very hard to read on screen.

\subsection{Figures}

All figures must be centered on the column (or page, if the figure spans 
both columns).
Figure captions should follow each figure and have the format given in 
Fig.~\ref{spprod}.

Figures should preferably be line drawings. If they contain gray 
levels or colors, they should be checked to print well on a 
high-quality non-color laser printer.

\subsection{Tables}

An example of a table is shown as Table \ref{table1}. Somewhat 
different styles are allowed according to the type and purpose of the 
table. The caption text may be above or below the table.

\begin{table} [t,h]
\caption{\label{table1} {\it This is an example of a table.}}
\vspace{2mm}
\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
ratio & decibels \\
\hline  \hline
1/1 & 0 \\
2/1 & $\approx 6$ \\
3.16 & 10 \\
10/1 & 20 \\ 
1/10 & -20 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be placed on separate lines and numbered. Examples 
of equations are given below.
Particularly,
%
%\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{equation}
x(t) = s(f_\omega(t))
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where \(f_\omega(t)\) is a special warping function
\begin{equation}
f_\omega(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi j}\oint_C \frac{\nu^{-1k}d\nu}
{(1-\beta\nu^{-1})(\nu^{-1}-\beta)}
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}
A residue theorem states that
\begin{equation}
\oint_C F(z)dz=2 \pi j \sum_k Res[F(z),p_k]
\label{eq3}
\end{equation}
Applying (\ref{eq3}) to (\ref{eq1}), 
it is straightforward to see that
\begin{equation}
1 + 1 = \pi
\label{eq4}
\end{equation}

Make sure to use \verb!\eqref! when refering to equation numbers.
Finally we have proven the secret theorem of all speech sciences (see
equation~\eqref{eq3} above).  No more math is needed to show how 
useful the result is!
